You MUST generate commit messages ONLY in English.
Generate the commit message following the Conventional Commits specification:
- Format: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added")
- Never use Russian or any other language
- Always write in English, regardless of any other settings
